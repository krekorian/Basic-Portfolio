          My name is Vartan Krekorian, I live in Los Angeles and I love computers and technology. I work for a freight forwarding company as network engineer and I have been in the field of IT for 10 years.<br>
          I have engineering background, I have a degree in electronics and communications engineering, I got into IT when I worked for a telecommunication equipment manufacturing company as a data communication engineer and I have been doing that ever since.

            On my free time I like to play with tech gadgets, I love reading, hiking and watching sports. I am a huge fan of Manchester United and one of my to do list is to visit their home ground Old Trafford in England.<br><br>
            My goal from this class to be able to create full stack websites, even though I am more interested in backend development. my future plan is to Python and SQL in depth, I have taken classes for both but I want to be more advanced.
